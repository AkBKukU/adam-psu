 
 - Revision needed- 
U2 Power pad not exposed on bottom for manual assembly
R1 connects to GND instead of +12V preventing U1 from turning on
All touch points too small
SW1 power switch on position reversed
SW1 power switch needs more clearance to depress switch

 - Resolvable / non-functional - 
R4 Power switch FET Gate pull down needs to be 1k
R7 RefDes under C11
bottom label text duplicated
C6 1 <-> U1 6 trace width narrow
Q1 Power switch FET detaches GND but non-isolated PSU may still provide a current path

 - Performance - 
-5V Rail ripple higher than I would like
